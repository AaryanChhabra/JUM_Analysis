suppose we have our featurecounts output.
what we have is some columns, and each coulmn bellings to a particular sample.
we can open the thing in exel and rename each column as col and mutant.

suppose countdata is the file with this information.


to read it
countdata = read.csv('readcounts.csv', header = 1)
this will assign the first row a header


we can assign row name to the dta as 


rownames(countdata) = countdata$Geneid
so, the column of Geneid will be assigned as the first column giving name to each row.

now to remove the first column as it is no longer needed. We do:

countdata=countdata[,-1]

we can rename the cloumns as:

columns_name = c("col_1","col_2"...)

colnames(countdata) =columns_name

we can get an estimate of total events in each column by

barplot(colSums(countdata/1e6))

this will divide the y axis by 1 million

#we might also see a good number of zeros in our data; to get an estimate of that we take a column and make a histogram of that by:

hist(countdata$col_name, br=100)

#will split things in 100 bins, so if the majority is zero, we will see  big ass bar on zero and almost nothing on the other bars.

#the problem is: the zero bin is too high, making other bins touching the x axis itself. So, we do a log2 transformation.

#doing a log 2 transform basically means how many times that number can be divided by 2:

like log2(8) would mean 3

to do it:

logCountData = log2(1+countdata)

we added 1 as log2(0) would make the value -infinity.

and the zeros will stay zero 

we create something called coldata, that has one column as the geneid, 2nd as the its genotype, 3rd is the treatment.

we make it as:

coldata = as.data.frame(cbind(colnames(countdata), mut, treatment))
